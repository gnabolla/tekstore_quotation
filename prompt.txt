I want it to have CRUD for agency cause it will be repetitive to give quote to them

the request for quotation have budget given by agency. my quote should be lower that it, so we should have an input of the budget.

I should input the Item name and price, then there should be a dynamic mark up. and the calculated final price will be put on pdf quotation.

we should have all of this:
Creating new quotations
Editing existing quotations
Converting quotations to invoices
Printing/exporting quotations as PDF
Tracking status of quotations (pending, approved, declined)

Will this be a standalone system or part of a larger application?
I will add some features later on.

Do you have any specific design requirements or preferences for the user interface?
you decide.

I attached repo we will use as template or MVC of the project.

we will use xampp
